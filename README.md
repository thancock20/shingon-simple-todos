# Shingon Simple Todos

This is the Simple Todos app from the Meteor tutorial. Reworked to use:

* The Mantra architecture on the client.
* Astronomy as a model.
* JSS for styling.
* React Storybook to visually test the components.
* Gagarin for integration tests of the methods and publication. (Assumes Gagarin is installed globally).

Also, all the Actions, Components, and Containers are unit tested with Mocha, Chai, Enzyme, and Sinon.
